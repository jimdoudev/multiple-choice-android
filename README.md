# Multiple Choice Test App for Android

This is a simple multiple choice test android app I created as a project for my MSc/ ICT at UniWA.

## Instructions

1. Load the whole project to your Android Developer Studio and install on an Android device of your choice. 
2. You can alter, add or remove questions and answers by editing the MultipleChoiceProject.db file in the `app/src/main/assets folder`.
